# core dir Instruction

The core layer is where we place everything unrelated to our domain, such as utilities, technical implementations, or API.  

**Examples:**  

- Functions that connect to your database
- Utilities that you use to authenticate users the provider to send emails
- Reusable UI components not related to any domain (ex. Dropdown, Button, TextInput) and more.
